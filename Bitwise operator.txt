	---Bitwise Operators-----
a = 5;	  0 0 0 0 1 0 1
b = 7;	  0 0 0 0 1 1 1
a&b(and) ; 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 that is equal to 5
a|b(or)  ; 	  0 0 0 0 1 1 1 that is equal to 7;
    XOR(Exactly 1 bit should be 1)
1^1 =0 
0^1 = 1
1^0 =1
0^ 0 =0

a =    1 0 1	(5)
b =    1 1 1(7)
a^b= 0 1 0(2)
***The XOR of same numbers is always 0.
