PARTS OF RECURSION BASICS

1. BASE CASE
2. Recursive call(to work towards base class)


Easiest way to approach to Recursion Problems
"Magical " Recursion Rule = Principal of Mathematical Induction(PMI)
1) Figure out the Base Case
2) Assume sub problems can be solved by recursion(automatically)
3) Using the sub problems write the answer for the current problem
